Comment: The differential diagnosis may include an granuloma annulare-like hypersensitivity reaction.  Features characteristic of erythema migrans are not identified and an immunostain was performed, which is negative for spirochetal organisms.  Unfortunately, biopsy findings are often non-specific, and the sensitivity of the special stain is low for this disease. If there is clinical concern, correlation with serology and cutaneous findings is recommended. Treatment may be prudent if there is high clinical suspicion for Lyme disease.
