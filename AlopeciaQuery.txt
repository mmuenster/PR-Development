벢D18-121913베. Right medial frontal scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% CHANGES MOST SUGGESTIVE OF PSORIATIC ALOPECIA (PLEASE SEE COMMENT).  Comment: An increase in catagen/telogen hairs, increase in miniaturized hairs, and presence of a superficial and deep perivascular and perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate in the absence of significant follicular destruction, are the features that have been described in alopecia associated with psoriasis. The lack of follicular destruction is against a scarring alopecia such as central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia or lichen planopilaris.   Initial and multiple levels were examined. Sections from both biopsies show psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with foci of parakeratosis containing neutrophils (best seen in biopsy B), associated with a superficial perivascular and deep perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate with numerous plasma cells.  There is an increase in catagen/telogen (20 %) and miniaturized hairs, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of approximately 1:3 in biopsy B, and approximately 3:1 in biopsy A. No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain, in either biopsy. T. pallidum immunostains were performed fro completeness sake (given the number of plasma cells present), which are negative for spirochetal organisms in both biopsies.  %%88305%%%%88312%%%%psalo%%  B.

벢D18-123134베. Right superior parietal scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% LICHEN PLANOPILARIS.  Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  There is a ruptured follicular unit. At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin. A PAS stain i negative for hyphae and fails to demonstrate a thickened basement membrane zone.

The differential diagnosis of histologic findings would also include a recovery phase of an alopecia areata that has gone into remission.  Sections show decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The number of miniaturized hairs is increased and the percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles is mildly increased.

벢D18-123921베. Left scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% SUGGESTIVE OF LICHEN PLANOPILARIS.  Comment: Although the findings are very subtle, there is overall decrease in follicular density associated with concentric fibroplasia and focal patchy interface injury with lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate, suggestive of lichen planopilaris. No interfollicular interface injury, increase in dermal mucin, or deep perifollicular inflammation or perivascular inflammation as expected in lupus is seen. Diagnostic features of alopecia areata are no seen. Interpretation is limited due to the small number of follicular units present for evaluation, precluding a more definitive diagnosis.  As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus). The submitted clinical note and image are reviewed (and are appreciated).

Due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. This case was reviewed by Dr. Elsa Velazquez who concurs with the above interpretation.  Approximately 35 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring, and the epidermis is unremarkable. Patchy superficial and deep perivascular lymphoid inflammation is noted. No interface injury or increase in dermal mucin is noted. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is within normal limits. There is a significant increase in miniaturized hair follicles, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of approximately 2:1.

벢D18-124849베. Right lower cutaneous lip, Punch biopsy: %%P%% CONSISTENT WITH ALOPECIA AREATA, WITH SUPERIMPOSED ECZEMATOUS DERMATITIS.  Comment:   Sections show follicular miniaturization with a modest catagen-telogen shift. While not definitive, these findings in conjunction with the clinical appearance of the lesion are most consistent with alopecia areata. There is no evidence of scarring. There is also follicular epidermal spongiosis and the periodic acid-Schiff stain shows pityrosporum yeast in the stratum corneum, suggestive of a superimposed eczematous or allergic contact dermatitis, or possibly a pityrosporum folliculitis. Although mucinosis is not identified with an alcian blue stain, due to the presence of focal follicular exocytosis of the infiltrate, immunohistichemical stains were performed, which show a non-diagnostic pattern, with variable CD3, CD4 and CD8 expression throughout several levels of the biopsy; however, procurement of levels is limited by the Headington processing technique for alopecia. The H&E and immunophenotypic findings support a reactive process; Since very early stages of cutaneous T-cell dyscrasia can mimic spongiotic dermatitis histologically, however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended, particularly if clinical progression occurs despite conservative therapeutic measures, and/or if the patient has been recently applying topical therapy (as this can affect the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings).

The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission).

However, rare foci of follicular interface injury is present which favors LPP and LE over CCCA.  Additionally, while lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, favors the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, some of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin. Approximately 9 hair follicles are present for evaluation (normal of approx. 38 follicles in Caucasians and approx. 21 follicles in African-Americans for a 4 mm punch).

This increase in telogen hairs is also seen in biopsy B, further supporting the diagnosis of telogen effluvium. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is also favored in this biopsy given the slight increase in hair shaft size variability and slight increase in miniaturized hairs (and the clinical presentation of bifrontal thinning of the hair). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of androgenetic alopecia, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.    Initial and multiple levels were examined. Approximately 32 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased to over 20%. There is a slight increase in miniaturized hair follicles, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of approximately 3.5:1. Within the subcutis, there is an increase in follicular streamers. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).   Reference: Wohltmann WE, Sperling L. Histopathologic diagnosis of multifactorial alopecia.

벢D18-3788베. Scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% LICHEN PLANOPILARIS.  Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus.  The lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for hyphae).

벢D18-4607베. Left central parietal scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% SCALP BIOPSY WITH FOCAL LYMPHOCYTIC INFLAMMATION AND PIGMENT INCONTINENCE WITHIN COLLAPSED FOLLICULAR STELLA (PLEASE SEE COMMENT).   Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle and interpretation is also limited due to the small number of hair follicles present (only 6) for evaluation, precluding a more definitive diagnosis. The epidermis is essentially unremarkable, without significant scale formation or spongiosis and diagnostic features of seborrheic dermatitis are not appreciated in the examined sections.  Sebaceous glands are intact and no dermal fibrosis is seen (arguing against a primary scarring alopecia). Presence or absence of miniaturization or increase in telogen hairs cannot be assessed adequately due to the small number of follicles present. While the presence of focal lymphoid inflammation in 2 collapsed stella in the subcutis raises the consideration of alopecia areata in the appropriate clinical context, it is not diagnostic as the histologic differential diagnosis for this finding could also include nonspecific folliculitis, syphilitic alopecia, or the non-cicatricial alopecia that can be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. Initial and multiple levels were examined. The submitted clinical note is reviewed (and is appreciated).

Comment: While the findings in the biopsy are subtle and the percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is not significantly increased, in the resolving phase of telogen effluvium the biopsy findings are essentially within normal limits, and therefore these findings are consistent with resolving telogen effluvium in this clinical context. There is also focal dermal scarring fibrosis with adjacent chronic folliculitis. Such a finding is favored to represent incidental sequela of prior folliculitis/ruptured follicle.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy may be secondary to hair styles, grooming techniques (such as excessive brushing), or chronic hair plucking (trichotillomania).  There is a decrease in terminal follicle density, without evidence of scarring. There is some evidence of follicular distortion and trauma. There is an increased percentage of miniaturized hair follicles which may represent a background of early female pattern alopecia or may be related to the traction alopecia. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus). There are superficial inflammatory changes that may be consistent with associated seborrheic dermatitis. Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. Interpretation is limited due to the small number of follicular units present for evaluation, precluding a more definitive diagnosis.  As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. A way to distinguish between the two is to perform paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved area of alopecia (central crown/vertex) and uninvolved scalp (usually occiput), as it can help establish a definite diagnosis of early AGA with or without concomitant TE.   Initial and multiple levels were examined. Approximately 20 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, sebaceous glands are intact, and the epidermis is unremarkable.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage. Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.  If clinically indicated, paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved zone of alopecia and normal uninvolved scalp may be helpful in establishing a more definitive diagnosis.  Initial and multiple deeper sections were examined.  Sections show a slight decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are essentially within normal limits, without evidence of a significant increase in miniaturized or telogen hairs, inflammation, or scarring. The lack of significant histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia may be due to an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission), very early androgenetic alopecia with subthreshold diagnostic findings, or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.  Due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, additional punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered, if clinically indicated.  This case was reviewed by Dr. Mandana Mahmoodi who concurs with the above interpretation.   Initial and multiple levels were examined and show a total of 4 hair follicles for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The terminal to vellus hair ratio and percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles are essentially within normal limits.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. A way to distinguish between the two is to perform paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved area of alopecia (central crown/vertex) and uninvolved scalp (usually occiput), as it can help establish a definite diagnosis of early AGA with or without concomitant TE.  Approximately 15 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable.

Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. The presence of interfollicular interface injury as well as the depth of perifollicular inflammation and perivascular extension of the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lupus over lichen planopilaris in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate, which extends to the suprabulbar portion of the follicles. The epidermis demonstrates interface injury as well, and acanthosis with hyperkeratosis. Pigment casts are present in the deep dermis/superficial subcutis, some associated with follicular bulbs.

Comment: The differential diagnosis for scarring alopecia includes lichen planopilaris, connective tissue disease and chronic alopecia areata. The advanced nature of the findings precludes definitive categorization of the underlying process. Additional punch biopsy from an early lesion (the advancing edge of the process), preferably 4 mm in size, could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  Sections show prominent dermal fibrosis with fibrous tracts. There is a marked decrease in follicular unit density and minimal inflammation. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus). The relative lack of significant lymphoid infiltrate or marked lymphocyte atypia preclude a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides in this specimen. If the lesion has been recently topically treated, histological findings may be suppressed. Because there is minimal lymphoid inflammation, immunochemical or molecular studies are unlikely to be contributory, but they are available upon request.  Because lymphocytic dyscrasias may evolve over time, mimicking dermatitis in early stages, continued clinical observation and additional sampling over time may be appropriate.  %%88305%%%%88312%%%%isa%%3/8/2018

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. A way to distinguish between the two is to perform paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved area of alopecia (central crown/vertex) and uninvolved scalp (usually occiput), as it can help establish a definite diagnosis of early AGA with or without concomitant TE.  Approximately 12 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased to over 15-20% in some sections. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.  If clinically indicated, paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved zone of alopecia and normal uninvolved scalp may be helpful in establishing a more definitive diagnosis.

벢D18-49914베. Left parietal scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% NONSCARRING ALOPECIA WITH INCREASE IN MINIATURIZED HAIRS, CONSISTENT WITH ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA (PLEASE SEE COMMENT).  Comment: There is a marked increase in miniaturized hairs, which is consistent with androgenetic alopecia. Given the patchy nature of the hair loss clinically, consideration was also given to alopecia areata (as miniaturization is also a feature of this disorder); however, in alopecia areata there is also an increase in catagen/telogen hairs and often residual peribulbar inflammation, neither of which are present in this biopsy, precluding that diagnosis in this biopsy. Since the clinical and histologic findings seem somewhat incongruous, clinical correlation is recommended to ensure that the biopsy is representative of the underlying clinical disorder, particular as interpretation is somewhat limited due to the relatively small number of follicular units present for evaluation. As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  Initial and multiple levels were examined. Approximately 18 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is within normal limits (approximately 16 percent).

Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury is lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While differentiation between these two processes can be difficult on biopsies which do not a significant number of hair follicles for evaluation (such as this one) and therefore lichen planopilaris cannot be entirely excluded,  the presence of interfollicular interface injury and increased dermal mucin, as well as the depth of perifollicular inflammation and perivascular extension of the inflammation, favor the diagnosis of lupus over lichen planopilaris in this biopsy. Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.  Initial and multiple levels were examined and only 7 hair follicles are present for evaluation. Sections show epidermis and upper dermis. At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate, which extends to the suprabulbar portion of the follicles. The epidermis demonstrates interface injury as well, and acanthosis with hyperkeratosis. There is also an increase in dermal mucin.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and mild increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases. As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. A way to distinguish between the two is to perform paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved area of alopecia (central crown/vertex) and uninvolved scalp (usually occiput), as it can help establish a definite diagnosis of early AGA with or without concomitant TE.  .

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with mild perifollicular fibrosis, miniturization, with slightly increased telogen hairs and the suggestion of traumatized hair follicles favoring traction alopecia, which can be secondary to hair styles, grooming techniques, or chronic hair plucking.  Clinical correlation is advised, particularly given the subtle nature of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include early androgenetic alopecia.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. A way to distinguish between the two is to perform paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved area of alopecia (central crown/vertex) and uninvolved scalp (usually occiput), as it can help establish a definite diagnosis of early AGA with or without concomitant TE.  Approximately 16 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased to over 15-20% in some sections. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles.

Comment: Features characteristic of lupus erythematosus and lichen planopilaris are not identified. The folliculitis decalvans pattern of scarring alopecia is seen in scalp biopsies of advanced inflammatory cicatricial alopecia. It is most commonly seen in the advanced stage of central centrifugal cicatrial alopecia (CCCA), although it can occasionally be seen in the setting of other scarring alopecias, such as lichen planopilaris, acne keloidalis, and discoid lupus. The degree of inflammation and follicle destruction makes assessment for an underlying cause difficult. Additional sampling from an early lesion (the advancing edge of the process), preferably 4 mm in size, could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.

The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings.

The differential diagnosis includes an early stage of androgenetic alopecia, resolving telogen effluvium, or alopecia areata that has gone into remission.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased and there is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles. No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain.

While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin.

Comment:  Sections show prominent concentric perifollicular fibrosis with focal low-density follicular epithelial interface inflammation and evidence of follicular distortion and trauma. There is also eccentric epithelial atrophy with focal early desquamation. This pattern may be associated with chronic traction, including secondary to hair styles, grooming techniques (such as excessive brushing), or chronic hair plucking (trichotillomania). Late lesions of frontal fibrosing alopecia may also show similar changes. The percentage of catagen/telogen follicles is increased, and a component of concurrent telogen effluvium is possible. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). Section show increased catagen/telogen hairs in some sections. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).   New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.

Comment:The limited degree of perifollicular fibrosis and lack of sinus tract formation militate against dissecting cellulitis.  The folliculitis decalvans pattern of scarring alopecia is seen in scalp biopsies of advanced inflammatory cicatricial alopecia. It is most commonly seen in the advanced stage of central centrifugal cicatrial alopecia (CCCA), although it can occasionally be seen in the setting of other scarring alopecias, such as lichen planopilaris, acne keloidalis, and discoid lupus. The degree of inflammation and follicle destruction makes assessment for an underlying cause difficult. Additional sampling from an early lesion (the advancing edge of the process), preferably 4 mm in size, could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated. This case was reviewed by Dr. Alejandro Soler who concurs with the above interpretation.     Sections show dense dermal peri-infundibular acute and chronic inflammation with intrafollicular pustule formation, and follicle destruction with giant cell reaction to hair shaft material.

Comment: An increase in catagen/telogen hairs, increase in miniaturized hairs, and presence of a superficial and deep perivascular and perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate in the absence of significant follicular destruction, are the features that have been described in alopecia associated with psoriasis. The lack of follicular destruction is against a scarring alopecia such as central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia or lichen planopilaris.   Initial and multiple levels were examined. Sections from both biopsies show psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with foci of parakeratosis containing neutrophils (best seen in biopsy B), associated with a superficial perivascular and deep perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate with numerous plasma cells.  There is an increase in catagen/telogen (20 %) and miniaturized hairs, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of approximately 1:3 in biopsy B, and approximately 3:1 in biopsy A.

벢D18-123921베. Left scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% SUGGESTIVE OF LICHEN PLANOPILARIS.  Comment: Although the findings are very subtle, there is overall decrease in follicular density associated with concentric fibroplasia and focal patchy interface injury with lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate, suggestive of lichen planopilaris. No interfollicular interface injury, increase in dermal mucin, or deep perifollicular inflammation or perivascular inflammation as expected in lupus is seen. Diagnostic features of alopecia areata are no seen. Interpretation is limited due to the small number of follicular units present for evaluation, precluding a more definitive diagnosis.  As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.

Comment:   Sections show follicular miniaturization with a modest catagen-telogen shift. While not definitive, these findings in conjunction with the clinical appearance of the lesion are most consistent with alopecia areata. There is no evidence of scarring. There is also follicular epidermal spongiosis and the periodic acid-Schiff stain shows pityrosporum yeast in the stratum corneum, suggestive of a superimposed eczematous or allergic contact dermatitis, or possibly a pityrosporum folliculitis. Although mucinosis is not identified with an alcian blue stain, due to the presence of focal follicular exocytosis of the infiltrate, immunohistichemical stains were performed, which show a non-diagnostic pattern, with variable CD3, CD4 and CD8 expression throughout several levels of the biopsy; however, procurement of levels is limited by the Headington processing technique for alopecia. The H&E and immunophenotypic findings support a reactive process; Since very early stages of cutaneous T-cell dyscrasia can mimic spongiotic dermatitis histologically, however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended, particularly if clinical progression occurs despite conservative therapeutic measures, and/or if the patient has been recently applying topical therapy (as this can affect the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings).

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show early miniaturization and a mild increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. Approximately 46 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is slighly increased, but within normal limits. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of appoximately 7:1. Within the subcutis, there is an increase in follicular streamers. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).

벢X18-3546베. Right temple, Punch: %%P%% NON-SCARRING NON-INFLAMMATORY ALOPECIA, CONSISTENT WITH EARLY TRACTION ALOPECIA.  Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with slightly increased telogen hairs and the suggestion of traumatized hair follicles favoring early traction alopecia, which can be secondary to hair styles, grooming techniques, or chronic hair plucking. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process and miniaturization is absent. Clinical correlation is advised, particularly given the subtle nature of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage. Due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, additional punch biopsy, preferably 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered, if clinically indicated.  Approximately 11 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is slightly increased and there is the suggestion of traumatized hair follicles. Definitive miniaturization is not seen.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. Approximately 19 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased to over 15-20% in some sections. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of approximately 2:1. Within the subcutis, there is an increase in follicular streamers. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).

While the differential diagnosis for this scarring alopecia includes tinea capitis, no fungi are detected with multiple periodic acid-Schiff and GMS stains performed on multiple levels.  Other considerations, although the histology is not typical, could include traction alopecia and lupus erythematosus.  Additionally, there are some histologic features of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia and lichen planopilaris, although the demographics would be unusual in this case.  The unusual histology and advanced nature of the findings precludes definitive categorization of the underlying process.  An sdditional punch biopsy from an early lesion (the advancing edge of the process), preferably 4 mm in size, could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture, with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands.

Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with free hair shaft granulomas and includes central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia and lichen planopilaris. The lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation militate against lupus in this biopsy.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.

While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus). %%88305%%%%88312%%%%lpp%% 1/5/2018

Comment: The folliculitis decalvans pattern of scarring alopecia is seen in scalp biopsies of advanced inflammatory cicatricial alopecia. It is most commonly seen in the advanced stage of central centrifugal cicatrial alopecia (CCCA), although it can occasionally be seen in the setting of other scarring alopecias, such as lichen planopilaris, acne keloidalis, and discoid lupus. The degree of inflammation and follicle destruction makes assessment for an underlying cause difficult. Additional sampling from an early lesion (the advancing edge of the process), preferably 4 mm in size, could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.

Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with probable concomitant telogen effluvium (TE).

It is most commonly seen in the advanced stage of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), although it can occasionally be seen in the setting of other scarring alopecias, such as lichen planopilaris, acne keloidalis, and discoid lupus. The degree of inflammation and follicle destruction makes assessment for an underlying cause difficult. Additional sampling from an early lesion (the advancing edge of the process), preferably 4 mm in size, could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  Sections show dense dermal peri-infundibular acute and chronic inflammation with intrafollicular pustule formation, and follicle destruction with giant cell reaction to hair shaft material.

While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.  Sections show a slight decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The number of miniaturized hairs is slightly increased and the percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles is essentially within normal limits.  A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).  This case was reviewed by Dr. Darren Whittemore who concurs with the above interpretation.   %%88305%%%%88312%%%%faga%% 1/26/2018

벣D18-23701베. Right parietal scalp, Biopsy: %%P%% NON-SCARRING NON-INFLAMMATORY ALOPECIA, CONSISTENT WITH EARLY ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA AND POSSIBLE CONCOMITANT TELOGEN EFFLUVIUM.  Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. Approximately 34 hair follicles are present for evaluation (normal of approx. 38 follicles in Caucasians and approx. 21 follicles in African-Americans for a 4 mm punch).  Approximately 8 telogen and 11 miniaturized hairs are present.  There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased to over 20% in some sections. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of appoximately 2:1. Within the subcutis, there is an increase in follicular streamers. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).

벣D18-24300베. Right forehead, Punch biopsy: %%P%% CONSISTENT WITH FRONTAL FIBROSING ALOPECIA (LICHEN PLANOPILARIS).  Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes frontal fibrosing alopecia/lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of frontal fibrosing alopecia over lupus, particularly in this clinical context.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.

Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. A way to distinguish between the two is to perform paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved area of alopecia (central crown/vertex) and uninvolved scalp (usually occiput), as it can help establish a definite diagnosis of early AGA with or without concomitant TE. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased to over 15-20% in some sections. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles. Within the subcutis, there is an increase in follicular streamers.

Scalp, Punch: %%P%% NON-SCARRING NON-INFLAMMATORY ALOPECIA, SEE COMMENT.  Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be in favor with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. Sections show a slight decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The number of miniaturized hairs is slightly increased and the percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles is essentially within normal limits.

벣D18-39666베.  Scalp, Punch: %%P%% NON-SCARRING NON-INFLAMMATORY ALOPECIA.  Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle and interpretation is also limited due to the relatively small number of follicular units present (16) for evaluation, precluding a more definitive diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes an early stage of androgenetic alopecia, resolving telogen effluvium, or alopecia areata that has gone into remission. As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  Initial and multiple deeper sections were examined.  There is a slight decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The terminal to vellus hair ratio and percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles are essentially within normal limits.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.  If clinically indicated, paired punch biopsies (preferably 4 mm in size) from the most involved zone of alopecia and normal uninvolved scalp may be helpful in establishing a more definitive diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury is lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. Differentiation between these two processes can be difficult on biopsies which do not contain subcutis or a significant number of hair follicles for evaluation, as distinction is based on a variety of factors, including examination of the depth of the inflammation, presence of deep dermal mucin deposition, involvement of interfollicular epithelium, and perivascular extension of inflammation. The lack of deep dermis and subcutis for evaluation in this biopsy therefore precludes definitive categorization. A repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  Sections show epidermis and upper dermis. There is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture, with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands.

벣D18-56561베. Right crown of scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% SCARRING ALOPECIA, MOST CONSISTENT WITH FOLLICULITIS DECALVANS.  Comment: The folliculitis decalvans pattern of scarring alopecia is seen in scalp biopsies of advanced inflammatory cicatricial alopecia. It is most commonly seen in the advanced stage of central centrifugal cicatrial alopecia (CCCA), although it can occasionally be seen in the setting of other scarring alopecias, such as lichen planopilaris and discoid lupus. Sections show dense dermal peri-infundibular acute and chronic inflammation and follicle destruction with giant cell reaction to hair shaft material. Initial and multiple levels were examined. Given the increased number of plasma cells a T. pallidum stain was performed and is negative. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).   The submitted clinical note and image are reviewed (and are appreciated).

벣D18-57878베. Right parietal scalp, Skin Biopsy: %%P%% NON-SCARRING NON-INFLAMMATORY ALOPECIA, CONSISTENT WITH  EARLY ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA.  Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation or telogen hairs.  Approximately 30 hair follicles are present for evaluation (normal of approx. 38 follicles in Caucasians and approx. 21 follicles in African-Americans for a 4 mm punch).  Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.  Sections show a slight decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The number of miniaturized hairs is slightly increased (5 miniaturized hairs) and the percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles is essentially within normal limits.  A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).

Comment:  The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, some of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis (2 of 14 hairs affected), and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin.

벣D18-58974베. Left superior parietal scalp, Punch biopsy: %%P%% NON-SCARRING NON-INFLAMMATORY ALOPECIA.  Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle and interpretation is also limited due to the relatively small number of follicular units present (3) for evaluation, precluding a more definitive diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes an early stage of androgenetic alopecia, resolving telogen effluvium, or alopecia areata that has gone into remission. As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.

Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia, in this case, includes lichen planopilaris, and central centrifugal scarring alopecia. The findings are not typical for those of lupus erythematosus in this case. Differentiation between these scarring processes can be difficult on biopsy, particularly in early lesions or when there are few intact hair follicles present for evaluation, as is the case in this biopsy. At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture, with fibrosis and decreased sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, very few of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate.

The histologic findings favor a resolving telogen effluvium, given the moderately increased telogen hairs without significantly increased miniaturized hairs.  Alopecia areata is deemed much less likely given the lack of active inflammation or significantly increased miniaturized hairs.  As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  Approximately 31 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. No significant increase in miniaturized hair follicles is appreciated (terminal to vellus hair ratio of 9:1). The percent catagen/telogen is increased, at approximately 27-33% percent.

The findings in this biopsy are non-specific and interpretation is also limited due to the relatively small number of follicular units present (13) for evaluation, precluding a more definitive diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes psoriatic alopecia and traction alopecia.  The findings of chemotherapy-related alopecia are broad and non-specific, however, it is not favored in this case.  Lichen simplex chronicus changes and non-specific granulomatous inflamation, probably secondary to a ruptured follicle, are also present.  As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, a repeat punch biopsy from the advancing edge could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.  Sections show psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis with a few neutrophils, associated with a superficial perivascular and deep perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate with plasma cells.  There is a slight increase in catagen/telogen hairs and foci of sebaceous gland atrophy.  There is focal sparse peribulbar lymphocytic inflammation with pigment incontinence and the focal suggestion of traumatized hair follicles.  Focal perifollicular granulomatous inflammation is also noted.  A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).

Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, some of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and focal interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus).

(SEE COMMENT)  Comment:   The submitted clinical note and image are reviewed (and are appreciated).  The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury is lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus.  Differentiation between these two processes can be difficult on biopsies which do not contain sufficient subcutis or a significant number of hair follicles for evaluation (i.e. in a small biopsy often smaller than 4 mm), as is the case in this biopsy, and as the distinction is based on a variety of factors, including examination of the depth of the inflammation, presence of deep dermal mucin deposition, involvement of interfollicular epithelium, and perivascular extension of inflammation.  Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.  Syphilitic alopecia can show some overlapping features as seen in this biopsy, but this is less favored, and the T. pallidum immunostain is negative (an RPR is recommended if clinically indicated).  Initial and multiple deeper sections were examined.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture, with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, some of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and rare interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate.

Comment:  The submitted clinical note and image are reviewed (and are appreciated).  The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury is lichen planopilaris (slightly favored) and lupus erythematosus.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture, with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a dense lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. The infiltrate extends somewhat deep and shows areas of perivascular inflammation as well.  There is no appreciable increase in interstitial mucin.  A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for basement membrane thickening or fungus).  This case was reviewed by Dr. Darren Whittemore who concurs with the above interpretation.   Follicular density = 13 (normal = 20-40 per 4 mm punch) Follicular unit morphology = distorted Hairs per follicular unit = 1 (normal = 2-4) Follicular dropout = present Sebaceous gland loss = present Catagen/Telogen hairs = 15% (normal  = 10%) Miniaturized (vellus) hairs = not increased Inflammatory infiltrate = dense perifollicular (interface around follicles) and perivascular Inflammatory cell type = lymphocytes Interface inflammation = present (follicular, not interfollicular) Dermal fibrosis (scarring) = absent Fibrous tracts (stelae) = few PAS stain = negative for fungus or basement membrane thickening  %%88305%%%%88312%%%%lmsai%% 4/23/2018

Comment: Given the clinical findings provided, the histologic features are consistent with a drug eruption. Of note, mucin is seen within the follicular epithelium which raises the possibility of follicular mucinosis (alopecia mucinosa); however, this histologic feature can also be seen as an incidental finding in other inflammatory  conditions, and correlation with clinical findings is necessary. If the condition persists despite adequate treatment, additional sampling should be considered.  Sections show a superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial lymphoid infiltrate with prominent eosinophils. There is mucin within the follicular epithelium and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the follicular epithelium.  There is no significant lymphocytic exocytosis in the interfollicular epithelium. Immunohistochemical stains were performed to evaluate the composition of the lymphoid infiltrate. The lymphocytes in the follicular epithelium are composed predominantly of CD3-positive T-lymphocytes with a normal ratio of CD4 and CD8 and normal staining with CD7. CD20 highlights scattered B-lymphocytes.  The immunohistochemical findings are consistent with a reactive infiltrate. No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain. Initial and multiple levels were examined. This case was reviewed at dermatopathology case conference with members of our physician staff. This case was reviewed by Dr. Scott Wickless.

While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.

As most histologic data on transverse sections for alopecia are based upon 4 mm punch biopsy specimens, and due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, if an additional biopsy is clinically indicated, a punch biopsy, preferably of 4 mm in size, from the advancing edge may be considered. Initial and multiple levels were examined. No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain. This case was reviewed by Dr. Darren Whittemore who concurs with the above interpretation.  %%88305%%%%88312%%%%lealo%%  5/3/2018

Differentiation between these processes can be difficult on biopsy, particularly in advanced lesions or when there are few intact hair follicles present for evaluation, as is the case in this biopsy. At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture, with fibrosis and decreased sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, several of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate early concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and a very sparse lymphocytic infiltrate.

Comment: The findings in this biopsy are subtle, with the suggestion of early miniaturization and without evidence of a significant increase in inflammation and only a slight increase in telogen hairs. Scarring is absent. While the findings would be consistent with early androgenetic alopecia in the appropriate clinical context, clinicopathologic correlation is required in this case, due to the subtly of the histologic findings. The slight increase in telogen hairs with focal pigment casts could represent a mild background traction or traumatic alopecia.  The differential diagnosis of subtle histologic findings in the clinical setting of a perceived alopecia would also include an area biopsied that is in the recovery phase of a pre-existing alopecia (such as resolving telogen effluvium or alopecia areata that has gone into remission) or a hair shaft disorder with external hair breakage.  Sections show a slight decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The number of miniaturized hairs is slightly increased and the percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles is slightly increased.  Focal pigment casts are noted.

Comment: There is no evidence of granuloma annulare, and there is also no evidence of true Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Rather, The S-100 and CD1a immunostains demonstrate remarkable Langerhans cell hyperplasia in association with a diffuse dermal infiltrate. The primary findings in this biopsy are those of follicular mucinosis, and the eosinophil-rich infiltrate (with associated eosinophilic panniculitis) represents an epiphenomenon.  Follicular mucinosis can serve as a harbinger of underlying cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In a patient of this age group, the presence of follicular mucinosis may be incidental or may represent so-called acneiform follicular mucinosis, which is often unassociated with underlying lymphoproliferative disease and a reactive process is favored. However, a total skin examination should be completed to screen for the possibility of concomitant mycosis fungoides in this patient. Several studies have demonstrated that there are no reliable histologic, immunophenotypic, or even molecular studies to definitively distinguish between idiopathic follicular mucinosis (alopecia mucinosa) and follicular mucinosis associated with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and the findings in this biopsy would be consistent with either, in the appropriate clinical context, as such appropriate clinical correlation is recommended.  Sections show mucin within the follicular epithelium.  There is a folliculotropic T-cell infiltrate. The interfollicular epithelium is largely spared. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus). No fungi or mycobacteria are identified on Gomori's methenamine silver or Fite stains. Immunohistochemical stains were examined (with appropriate controls) and show a heterogeneous T-cell predominant lymphohistiocytoid infiltrate relative to CD30, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, immunostaining patterns, supporting the aforementioned diagnosis. Initial and level sections were examined. The submitted clinical note and image are reviewed (and are appreciated). This case was reviewed by Dr. Jose Plaza who concurs with the above interpretation. This case is seen in consultation with the University of California San Francisco Dermatopathology Service (UCSF; Dr. Timothy McCalmont; DL18-62605) with diagnostic agreement, please see attached additional consult report. %%88305%%%%88312%%%%fmyx%%   6/19/2018

Comment: The findings in this biopsy show both early miniaturization and an increase in telogen hairs, without a significant increase in inflammation. Scarring is absent. Early androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is favored, with possible concomitant telogen effluvium (TE). New onset TE, or recurrent chronic TE, may unmask clinically the early stages of AGA, and interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). As it can be difficult to differentiate between early AGA and TE (as early AGA can itself also show a slight increase in telogen hairs), however, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.  Initial and multiple deeper sections were examined.  Approximately 33 hair follicles are present for evaluation. There is no evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. The percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is increased to 18%(6/33) in some sections. There is an increase in miniaturized hair follicles, with a terminal to vellus hair ratio of appoximately 2:1. Within the subcutis, there is an increase in follicular streamers. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus). Reference: Wohltmann WE, Sperling L. Histopathologic diagnosis of multifactorial alopecia.

Diagnostic features typical of lupus erythematosus are not appreciated in the examined sections.  Due to the sampling variability inherent in scalp biopsies for alopecia, additional sampling from the advancing edge could be considered, if clinically indicated.  There is a slight decrease in follicle density, with no evidence of scarring or significant inflammation. The terminal to vellus hair ratio and percentage of catagen/telogen hair follicles are essentially within normal limits.  A periodic acid-Schiff stain was utilized in the diagnostic evaluation (and is negative for fungus). %%88305%%%%88312%%%%nsnia%% 6/20/2018

Comment: The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands. At this level of sectioning, many of the remaining hair follicles demonstrate concentric perifollicular fibrosis, and interface injury with a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. No interfollicular interface injury is seen at the dermoepidermal junction, and there is no apparent increase in dermal mucin.

Comment: The presence of miniaturized hair follicles with a slight increase in catagen/telogen hairs supports the diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia, while the decrease in terminal follicle density with follicular distortion and some follicle units with retained sebaceous glands that lack terminal hairs, suggests superimposed chronic traction alopecia. Interestingly, a study of a large series of alopecia cases showed multifactorial alopecia with 2 or more patterns of alopecia in 12.5% of cases (see reference below). Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.  Sections show a decrease in terminal follicle density, without evidence of scarring or a significant inflammatory process, and the epidermis is unremarkable. There is evidence of follicular distortion and trauma. Miniaturized hair follicles are appreciated with a slight increase in the percentage of catagen/telogen follicles.

Given the clinical impression and the histopathological findings, however, the changes that are present would be consistent with lichen planopilaris. The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injury includes lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. While lupus cannot be entirely excluded, the lack of interfollicular interface injury or an increase in dermal mucin, as well as the lack of deep perifollicular inflammation or a significant perivascular component to the inflammation, support the diagnosis of lichen planopilaris over lupus in this biopsy.  Diagnostic features of folliculitis decalvans and pseudopelade of Brocq are not appreciated in the examined sections.  At the level of the isthmus, there is disruption of the normal follicular unit architecture,with fibrosis and decreased to absent sebaceous glands.
