벢D19-20855베. Left ankle, Punch biopsy: %%P%% PIGMENTED PURPURIC DERMATOSIS.  Comment:   Sections show a slight superficial perivascular lymphoid infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes and siderophages.  The submitted clinical note is reviewed (and is appreciated).  %%88305%%%%ppd%% 
벢D19-21038베. Left proximal pretibial region, Punch biopsy: %%P%% CONSISTENT WITH PIGMENTED PURPURIC DERMATOSIS.  Comment:   The differential diagnosis includes a viral process. Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. Sections show a slight superficial perivascular lymphoid infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes. No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain. Iron stain fails to demnstrate presence of hemosiderin. The submitted clinical note is reviewed (and is appreciated).  This case was reviewed at dermatopathology case conference with members of our physician staff.  %%88305%%%%ppd%% 
벢D19-25586베. Right distal lateral calf, Punch biopsy: %%P%% CONSISTENT WITH PIGMENTED PURPURIC DERMATOSIS.  Comment:   Sections show a slight superficial perivascular lymphoid infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes and rare siderophages. No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain.

벢D19-26838베. Left lower leg:%%P%% CONSISTENT WITH PIGMENTED PURPURIC DERMATOSIS.  Comment: Sections show a mild superficial perivascular lymphoid infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes. There is no evidence of vasculitis. %%88305%%%%ppd%%  B. Left temporal scalp:%%P%% CONSISTENT WITH ROSACEA.  Comment: No fungal hyphae are detected with a PAS stain.  Sections show slight acanthosis and mild spongiosis, with focal parakeratosis and an associated perivascular and perifollicular infiltrate of lymphoid and plasma cells in the superficial and mid-dermis. There is also telangiectatic blood vessels and solar elastosis. %%88305%%%%88312%%%%rosa%% 
벢D19-32012베. Left ulnar dorsal hand, Shave Biopsy:%%P%% LICHENOID DERMATITIS WITH PURPURA, CONSISTENT WITH PIGMENTED PURPURIC DERMATOSIS.  Comment: The findings are consistent with the lichenoid (Gougerot and Blum) variant of pigmented purpuric dermatosis. As this appears to be a solitary lesion clinically, however, the differential diagnosis would also include lichen aureus. Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. The submitted clinical note is reviewed (and is appreciated).  Initial and multiple levels were examined. Sections show a lichenoid lymphoid infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes and siderophages (confirmed on an iron stain). %%88305%%%%ppd%%  
벢D19-33759베. Left anterior medial malleolus, Punch biopsy: %%P%% CONSISTENT WITH PIGMENTED PURPURIC DERMATOSIS.  Comment: Initial and multiple deeper sections were examined.  Sections show a slight superficial perivascular lymphoid infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes and siderophages.  A PAS stain is negative for hyphae. %%88305%%%%88312%%%%ppd%% 
벣D19-24741베. Right anterior proximal thigh, Punch biopsy: %%P%% PIGMENTED PURPURIC DERMATOSIS, SEE COMMENT.  Comment: A number of clinical patterns of pigmented purpuric dermatoses are recognized; however, based on the clinical description this lesion might represent the "purpura annularis telangiectodes" subtype. There is no evidence of mycosis fungoides. Sections show a slight superficial perivascular lymphoid infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes and siderophages. Initial and multiple levels were examined. No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain. Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended. This case was reviewed by Dr. Darren Whittemore and Dr. Sadia Salim who are in concurrence with the above interpretation.  %%88305%%%%88312%%%%ppd%%
