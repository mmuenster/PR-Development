High power view is needed to evaluate such lesions (6/ 2018). ***Margins: Y (peripheral/deep) ***Diagnostic Text: Don't use "larger", If partial biopsy of a large lesion is taken, she will let you know (call Dr. Kovich to check size of lesion if necessary). Don't use melanocytic hyperplasia as a diagnosis (proliferation is OK). Use BaseSCC macro instead of Rocket Macro I. Correlate with clinical impression. Correlate with prior biopsy (when available). For Re-excisions: Whenever looking at a re-excision, please add the comment "The prior biopsy or report xxxx has been reviewed".  ***Recommendations: Y, prefers to have a straightforward recommendation to excise alesion if you feel it needs to be re-excised.You can usepersist but dont abuse it.  ***Other: Client feels that every time she calls, we upgrade the diagnosis and the recommendation.
